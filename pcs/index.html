                <p>The Projector Control System is a combination of both software and hardware that allows for the remote control of projectors. The controller can be accessed from any device on the same network as the device servers as long as the device possesses a web browser. The software can also be configured to control other devices that allow serial or network console control.</p>
                <p>The software is coded on the rock solid technologies that bring you the world wide web. The server is a combination of a linux operating system, a ruby on rails web server, and a ser2net serial device server. Questions about how these packages interact to for the backbone of this system can be answered if you send an email to the email link at the bottom of the page.</p>
