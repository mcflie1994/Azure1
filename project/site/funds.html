                    With this fundraiser in March, scouts go door to door selling candy bars. They cost $1 each with 50% going to support the scouts. Scouts also sell in front of certain stores during this period. Of the three selling fundraisers, this is the only fundraiser the scouts participate in in the spring.

                    Riverfest is the annual city wide event. On Sunday there is a final blow-out in the park. Lunch is a catered chicken meal and the scouts serve the meals. At the end of the event, the Monticello Lions club contributes some amount of the proceeds to the scout troop. These funds help support the troop in its day to day operations. Therefore all the scouts volunteer and benefit from the event.
